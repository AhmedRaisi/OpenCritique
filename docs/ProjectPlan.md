# High-Level Architecture:

## Frontend (React):

### Components:
- **Registration/Login**: Components to handle user onboarding.
- **Preferences Selector**: Components to let users select their favorite film/music types.
- **Critic Matcher**: Displays matched critics.
- **Recommendations Viewer**: Shows movie/music recommendations.

### State Management:
- Consider using Redux or the React Context API to manage global state.

### HTTP Client:
- Use Axios or Fetch to make API calls to the backend.

## Backend (Django):

### User Authentication:
- Use Django’s built-in authentication or `django-allauth` for enhanced authentication features.

### API:
- Set up Django Rest Framework (DRF) to create API endpoints.
  - **Endpoints**: registration, login, preferences update, get matched critics, get recommendations, etc.

### Matching Algorithm:
- Written in Python, it will take user preferences and compare them with the preferences or recommendations of the critics.

### Recommendation Engine:
- Another Python module that can take critic preferences and provide movie/music suggestions.

## Database (MongoDB):

### Schemas:
- **User**: Store personal details, hashed passwords, preferences, matched critics, etc.
- **Critic**: Store critic details, their preferences, and historical recommendations.
- **Recommendations**: Storing actual film and music recommendation details.

### Integration:
- Use `djongo` - a connector to use Django with MongoDB directly.

## AWS:

- **Elastic Beanstalk**: To deploy the Django backend and React frontend.
- **S3**: To store static files and media.
- **CloudFront**: To serve assets faster through a CDN.
- **RDS with MongoDB**: If you want a managed database service on AWS (note: MongoDB on RDS might not be a direct service; you might need to set up an EC2 instance or use Atlas, MongoDB's cloud service).
- **Route 53**: To manage your domain name and routing.
- **IAM**: For securing AWS service access.

## Interactions:

1. A user registers/logs in via the React frontend.
2. After login, they set their preferences which are sent to the Django backend and stored in MongoDB.
3. When they request matches, the Django backend processes the matching algorithm and returns suitable critics.
4. Recommendations are similarly fetched based on critic preferences and shown to the user.
5. AWS Elastic Beanstalk handles deployments and scaling, S3 & CloudFront deliver assets, and the database either runs on an EC2 instance or through Atlas.

## Security Considerations:

- **HTTPS**: Use AWS Certificate Manager to issue SSL certificates for your domain.
- **CORS**: Set it up in Django to ensure only your frontend can communicate with the backend.
- **Sanitize Inputs**: Ensure that all user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks, especially since you’re using MongoDB.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensure JWT or session-based auth mechanisms are securely implemented.
